## Table Notes ##

# Buttons
  - The scope mode / headers mode buttons only appear when ANDI detects that the
    table is using the html headers attribute. Otherwise, ANDI defaults to scope
    mode and doesn't display the toggle buttons.
    - NOTE: This means that these buttons should not be used with presentation
            tables (tANDI), and strange tables (uANDI).
 - Also, the markup button should not be used with presentation tables (tANDI)
   and strange tables (uANDI).
    - This is because it does not have any areas to be examined by it.
