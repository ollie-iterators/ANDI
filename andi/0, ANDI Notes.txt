# ANDI Notes:

1. The html5Hidden attribute does nothing and is just display:none.
   This is because if display is not none, the element with the hidden
   attribute will be visible

2. Use $("#ANDI508-additionalElementDetails").append(); to add things to ANDI that are used
   for debugging your fork of ANDI.
