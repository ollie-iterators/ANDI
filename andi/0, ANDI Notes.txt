# ANDI Notes:

1. The html5Hidden attribute does nothing and is just display:none.
   This is because if display is not none, the element with the hidden
   attribute will be visible

2. Use $("#ANDI508-additionalElementDetails").append(); to add things to ANDI that are used
   for debugging your fork of ANDI.

3. Add information about how to alter the code to work with taking contrast ratios of
   elements with opacity, and if you can figure out elements with background images
   - Changes (for now):
     - Added function updateLuminance
       - Used updateLuminance to get new luminance values
     - Made for loop to get contrastList before cANDI_data is made
     - Commented out the old way contrast was gotten
     - Changed contrast to contrastList
     - Changed ratio to Math.min(contrastList)
